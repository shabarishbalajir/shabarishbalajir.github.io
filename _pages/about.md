Hello! I am Shabarish. Welcome to my academic portfolio! I am a Final-year Undergraduate Mechanical Engineering student at IIT Madras Minoring in AI. I am interested in building data-driven, physics-informed machine learning models for scalable and interpretable scientific computing.

My research interests lie in turbulence modeling, Sci-ML for PDE-governed systems, and in building interpretable frameworks for physics-informed models. During my undergraduate, I worked on physics-informed inverse design with Dr. Nagabhushna Rao Vadlamani, time series turbulence with Dr. Mahesh Panchungula, and turbulence super-resolution and causality-aware Sci-ML approaches with Dr. Konduri Aditya. I am currently working with Dr. Chakravarthy Balaji for my Bacheloar's thesis on neural-operator guided spatio-temporal modeling of temperature fields in data-centers.

Research Interests
------
My goal is build foundational Sci-Ml models with a focus on model intrepretability that alleviate tradioanl bottllenecks in compuatational systems. State-of-the-art Sci-ML methologies offer signigicant advantages, but reliance on extensive iterative testing and limited reproducibility of results continue to hinder progress. To address these limitations, my goal is to develop foundational models augmented with principled interpretability frameworks and physical constraints which will be essential in bringing data-driven models towards mainstream, production-quality software for widespread use.

I am also fascinated by the rise of large language models and recent advances in agentic systems, and I aim to leverage these developments to build agentic frameworks that assist and accelerate scientific discovery. For a comprehensive overview of my research background, please refer to my [CV](/assets/pdf/Shabarish_Balaji_PhD_Caltech_CMS_Resume.pdf).
